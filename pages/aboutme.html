  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>
    Hello, My name is Alex.<br>
     I grew up in the east bay and have lived in San Francisco for the last 6 years.
     Prior to this I have worked in Restaurants but the lifestyle became too much of a burden to continue in the industry.
     I started looking into coding towards the end of last year and started taking it seriously at the beginning of this year.
     I am really looking forward to growing in this industry.<br>
     My hobbies in my free time are triathlons, hanging out with my dog, camping/backpacking,
     hiking, exploring new bars and restaurants, cooking, and watching Bay Area sports.
