  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>
    Hello! I am a software engineer based in San Francisco, CA. I graduated from
    Rithm School where I had experience working in Javascript, Python, React,
    Node, Express, Flask, Django, and Typescript. Prior to starting my journey
    towards becoming a software engineer, I was a general manager in the
    hospitality industry. I loved my career but was curious about technology.
    I started teaching myself Javascript and found a real passion for it.
    In early 2022, I decided to start the journey towards becoming a
    full-time software engineer. Now that I have graduated from a full
    stack coding bootcamp, I am looking for my first position in the industry.</p>
